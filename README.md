## Overview
This project was built for demonstration purpose using iOS best practices. It doesn't have or provide any commercial usage.
Auth flow only imitates user's authentication/actions.

App uses [Dog-api](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) for backend. It is free and amazing 🐕.

You might notice that this app doesn't have a fancy UI. That's because the project is concentrated on architecture and patterns rather than interfaces.
If you're looking for complex interfaces along with smooth animations, please check my other projects here: [CardsHolder](https://github.com/Kharauzov/CardsHolder) or [SwipeableCards](https://github.com/Kharauzov/SwipeableCards).
